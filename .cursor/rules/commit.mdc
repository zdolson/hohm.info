# commit skill (update-and-commit)
Trigger: user asks to commit changes.

## Steps
1. `git diff --name-only HEAD` — list changed files.
2. Group by folder. For each folder with changes:
   - Re-run gen-context logic on that folder.
   - Stage updated `CLAUDE.md` if changed.
3. Stage all intended files.
4. Write concise conventional commit message: `<type>(<scope>): <what changed>`.
5. Commit. Do NOT push unless asked.

## Commit message rules
- Types: feat | fix | refactor | chore | docs | test
- Scope: folder or feature name
- Body optional, only if non-obvious why
- No co-authored-by unless user requests
